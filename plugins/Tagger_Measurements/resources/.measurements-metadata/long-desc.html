<p><img src="ann-job-measurements.png" style="float: right"/>Annotate
<em>numbers</em> and <em>measurement expressions</em> in text.  This pipeline
recognises many types of measurements including length, temperature, time and
speed, and calculates their normalised values in the SI system of units.  These
annotations are ideal for indexing with M&iacute;mir, which supports queries in
one unit matching results expressed in another.</p>

<p>As a side-effect this pipeline also annotates tokens and sentences.</p>
