<p><img src="ann-job-annie-measurements.png" style="float: right"/><strong>ANNIE</strong>
is a named entity recognition pipeline that identifies basic entity types, such
as <em>Person</em>, <em>Location</em>, <em>Organization</em>, <em>Money</em>
amounts, <em>Time</em> and <em>Date</em> expressions.</p>

<p>This pipeline combines the basic ANNIE named entity system with taggers to
recognise numeric expressions (digits and words) and to annotate and normalise
measurement expressions with features giving their value in SI units.</p>
